#Simple Link and Content Tracker

##Brain dump
The idea is to take advantage of some of the database aspects of Git.

* I want to read "X".
* Add to the reading list.
* A hook / script grabs each link in the reading list, gets page is no folder exists. Hence I can manually do it to.

* If gzip - could save as gz as it is already done.
* Could use headless javascript to render the page.
